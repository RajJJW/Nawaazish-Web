                        <p>Due to the complete COVID-lockdown across the country, daily wage workers are left with no work & scarce government support.
                            The ones who are the only earning member of the family are affected the most.</p>

                        <p>Things ahead seem to be getting worse, as the lockdown has left some wrecking after-effects on the daily wage sector.</p>

                        <p>However, our Nawaazish Crew, a non-profit organization based in Delhi, is on a mission  help the needy, using an iterative model: 📈
                            <br />
                            1. Our organization procures supplies from wholesalers at a cheaper rate.
                            <br />
                            2. We then hand-over the ration to our ground delivery partners.
                            <br />
                            3. Our delivery partners pick up the packets from the wholesaler and provide ration to the ones in need.</p>


                        <p>What will the ration packet consist of?
                            <br />
                            The list includes, but isn't limited to:
                            <br />
                            1. Atta
                            <br />
                            2. Chawal
                            <br />
                            3. Channa dal</p>

                        <p>Each pack is procured at a cost ranging between ₹450 & ₹500/-</p>

                        <p>A contribution of ₹500 would provide a family of 4 with 7kg Atta, 7kg Rice, & 3.5kg Daal that usually lasts for 14 days.</p>


                        <p>To most of us, ₹500 might seem like a trivial amount, but it holds the power of feeding a family in need, & in uniting us as human beings. 🌠</p>

                    <p>October is Blindness Awareness Month which educates the public about both the diseases that cause blindness and the enormous capacity of those who suffer vision loss or total blindness themselves.
                       </p>
                    <p> The cultural conception of blindness is much different from its reality. “Blindness” is often presented as a completely incapacitating disability of total vision loss. In reality, many people suffering from vision loss live fulfilling, joyful lives and suffer degrees of vision loss, not total blindness. Children who are partially blind or suffer vision loss are particularly inspiring examples of how capable they can be.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Eyes a Gift of God</h3>
                    <p>Eyesight is one the most important senses. 80percent of what we perceive comes through our sense of sight. As we all know, light travels the fastest, hence making eyes the best sensory organ for protecting us from incoming dangers and threats. Hence taking care of eyesight becomes all the more that important.
                    </p><p>Healthy brain function needs healthy eyesight. The brain is our most vital organ, allowing us to live complex lives. Considering that your optic nerve connects your eyes and your brain, a healthy co-dependent relationship is necessary. By keeping your eyes healthy, you keep your brain healthy – improving your overall quality of life!
                </p>
                    <p>Good vision contributes to improved athletic ability, better driving skills, improved learning and comprehension and better quality of life.
                        Being one of the five senses, the importance of sight is already known to all. What is not known to people is that people can lose their eyesight due to diseases like diabetes, glaucoma or macular degeneration.                    </p>
                    <h3>Effects of Various Condition on Eyes</h3>
                    <p>Diabetic people are unable to regulate blood sugar levels, and hence, blood vessels that support the retina is also affected.

                    In macular degeneration, the macula, or the part of retina that helps us to focus on objects degenerates, hence leading to blindness.
                    Symptoms include loss of clear colour vision, appearance of distorted shapes, and even gradual loss of ability to see objects clearly.

                    Glaucoma is an eye disease, which is caused by the progressive damage to the optic nerve due to aging. In this disease, the fluid pressure inside the eye increases.
                    It is of two types – primary open-angle and acute angle-closure glaucoma.
                    The former shows no symptoms, while the latter shows symptoms like severe eye pain, nausea, redness in the eye, blurred vision or seeing coloured rings around lights.

                    We often ignore headaches or redness in the eye, thinking of it to be temporary. But, it is important to consult a doctor, because such symptoms can lead to absolute blindness if not treated properly.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Blindness Prevention</h3>

                    <p>Pay attention to any changes in your vision.
                    <br>If you start noticing changes in your vision, consult an eye doctor immediately. Signs to look for include:
                        <br>> Double vision
                        <br>> Hazy vision
                        <br>> Poor night vision
                        <br>> Red eyes
                        <br>> Flashes of light
                        <br>> Floaters
                        <br>> Swelling of your eyes or eyelids

                        <br><br>Eat a healthy and balanced diet.

                    Consider supplementing your diet with eye vitamins to make sure you are getting adequate amounts of the nutrients you need to keep your eyes healthy.

                    Exercise frequently.
                    Some studies suggest that regular exercise — such as walking — can reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration by up to 70 percent. *20-20-20 rule*
                    The rule says that for every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, a person should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Following the rule is a great way to remember to take frequent breaks. This should reduce eye strain caused by looking at digital screens for too long. *Distance from screen*
                    Position your computer screen so that:
                    it is between 40 and 76 centimetres (16 to 30 inches) from your eyes
                    the top is level with, or slightly below, your eyes.
                    Try to blink regularly. Focusing on a screen may make you blink less, which may make your eyes dry and uncomfortable.

                    <p>Sexual assault is not about sex, but about violence. If someone hits you with a plough, you wouldn't call it gardening
                        Due to the major lack of sex education in India, a lot of people, including children below the age seven encounter a sexual assault. The best way to avoid this is to promote sex education.
                        </p><p>Sex Education is a gradual process of gaining knowledge about the different touches, sexes, sexual techniques, practices etc. It is important for us to consider it a path rather than a destination to make our children aware of what their bodies undergo when they reach adolescence.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Good and Bad touches</h3>
                    <p>
                        Identification of good and bad touches is the first step towards combating sexual abuse against children. Not only this, but children should also be educated to speak against it, or talk to someone about it.
                        Activities which involve showing affection like hugging and holding hands are considered good touches.
                        Hitting, kicking or touching private parts are considered bad touches.
                        Children should be made aware about how they should not let anyone touch their genitals at any place, even at school as well. It is important to keep the channels of communication open so that a child can communicate even if the person committing the act is a known. It is vital to realize the need & the power of consent.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Every Assault is a Major Assault</h3>

                    The only thing worser than being assaulted is not reporting the assault, especially if it was sexual.
                    No, it wasn't just a touch, no, it wasn't just a small push, it was a sexual assault.
                    Molestation has many forms, and no form is "nothing major and doesn't need reporting." Being touched inappropriately does have a huge impact on physical, as well as on mental health of a person, and not doing anything about it, just because it was just a touch, becomes troublesome for the person, and the future victims as well.
                    It does no good other than normalising inappropriate behaviour as something that "𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐨𝐧𝐞, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   <h3>Martial Rape</h3>


                    Marital Rape refers to unwanted intercourse by a person with their partner obtained by force, threat of force, or physical violence, or when she is unable to give consent. Marital rape could be by the use of force only, a battering rape or a sadistic/obsessive rape. It is a non-consensual act of violent perversion by a person against their partner(predominantly women) where they are physically and sexually abused.

                    In the present day, studies indicate that between 10 and 14% of married women are raped by their husbands: the incidents of marital rape soars to 1/3rd to ½ among clinical samples of battered women. Sexual assault by one’s spouse accounts for approximately 25% of rapes committed.

                    In 2015 RIT Foundation filed a petition seeking to close this loophole and criminalize marital rape in India.
                    It is extremely important for the petition to not be postponed because as we speak there are millions of women who are being raped by their husbands within the confines of their homes.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Fallacy of Society</h3>


                    Sexual assault is a traumatic experience for any person. Furthermore, many victims who tell others about their assault must endure a "second assault" in the form of negative reactions, such as victim blaming and disbelief. One third to two thirds of victims may experience such reactions, which have negative mental and physical health effects on the victims.

                    <br>
                    <h3>Harassment by  Family</h3>


                    On an average, one girl gets raped in India every 15 minutes. And this statistic is based on the number of reported cases. There are so many cases that go unreported.

                    People don't report cases of molestation for a variety of reasons, the worst one being, that they were molested by someone in their family, and hence, instead of their family supporting them, they encourage girls to not to talk about it, to maintain their family reputation.

                    If you find yourself in such a situation, keeping quiet about it, will not help.
                    It is very difficult to talk about the time you were molested, but not talking about it will just make it difficult.

                    <p>Movies are usually nothing like real life. For instance, in movies, it’s usually a woman who faints on seeing blood, while in real life, every woman is used to seeing blood every month.
                        The menstrual cycle is a process when blood and mucosal tissue from the uterus gets discharged through a female’s vagina.
                        This process starts at puberty, and occurs considerably periodically every month. A normal menstrual cycle can be from three to eight days long.
                    </p>
                   <h3>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle</h3>
                    Periods can sometimes be too much, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is nothing but an underrated way to make them a bit more bearable.
                    Taking warm baths and using hot water bags helps in relieving period cramps.
                    Replacing caffeine with water, and exercising are also some effective ways.
                    Making a few improvements in one's diet such as adding more leafy and fibrous vegetables, and fruits with high water content are also important during a girl's menstrual cycle.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Importance of menstrual hygiene</h3>

                    Maintaining a good menstrual hygiene is a basic necessity for every girl and woman. Many females, even in developed countries, don’t have access to proper materials required for a good menstrual hygiene.
                    In some parts of our country, a woman’s periods are considered to be impure, and are thought to be something that should not be spoken of. Women in many families use an old cloth instead of pads, tampons or v-cups.
                    This is not only unhygienic, but is also the reason for a lot of problems such as introduction of bacteria into the urethra. The chances of cervical cancer increase due to improper menstrual hygiene.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Effect of Lockdown</h3>

                    The global pandemic has not only drastically affected the way the world works, but has also brought major changes in one’s lifestyle. For a lot of women, especially from backward casts and weak economic backgrounds, these changes have not been kind.
                    A new study shows that about twenty per cent of women are facing issues like irregular periods and severe menstrual cramps as the lockdown has brought drastic changes in their lifestyles affecting their hormonal balance.
                    Many women are forced to use other improvised unhygienic materials due to the unavailability of sanitary products.
                    About forty per cent of girls received sanitary napkins from government schools and Anganwadi centres. Due to the lockdown, schools and Anganwadi centres are now closed nationwide, creating a problem for those girls.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Stigmas</h3>
                    Around 23 million girls in India drop out of school when they start menstruating. In many areas, people tend to believe that once a girl starts to menstruate, she is no longer a child. Lack of functional toilets, sanitary napkins and awareness are major reasons for early dropouts.
                    A 14-year-old girl from Tamil Nadu named Kala had never heard of a sanitary pad. According to a survey, she used a cotton cloth during her periods like every other girl in her village.
                    Only 3% girls in rural India use sanitary hygiene products as they are either inaccessible or are too expensive. Using improvised unhygienic materials can lead to painful disorders like dysmenorrhoea and endometriosis.
                    Girls like Poornima Javardhana had to spend five days every month in a 'gaakor' - a hut outside her village where girls and women were banished during their cycle.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Go for environment friendly</h3>

                    With the connivance plastic offers comes the toxicity they hold for the environment. Plastic is also used in sanitary pads, and even though it is of great help to women, on an average, about 9000 tonnes of menstrual waste is generated monthly in India, most of it in the form of sanitary pads.
                    Sanitary pads effectively trap the moisture within, which becomes a breeding ground for various infections and allergies.
                    Hence, it is better to use alternatives to plastic sanitary pads.

                    <h3>What is Cyberbulling?</h3>

                        Cyberbullying, also known as online bullying, is the form of bullying that takes place at digital platforms or using electronic means. Everything - from hacking someone's phone to attacking a person via a digital platform is cyberbullying.



<br>
                        <h3>Think Brfore You Click</h3>

                        Cyber bullying affects people from any age or walk of life. Victims feel very distressed and alone when being bullied online. Many children feel unable to confide in an adult because they feel ashamed and wonder whether they will be judged, told to ignore it or close their account which they might not want to do. Recent statistics show that 20% of children and young people indicate fear of cyber bullies made them reluctant to go to school.

                        The online world can be difficult, but if you ever find yourself being threatened or troubled by somebody, tell about it to your parents and don't hesitate to report it to any cyber crime cell.

<br>


                    <h3>Pink T-Shirt Day</h3>

                        It is a message against cyberbullying. Millions of children around the world are at risk of online violence, sexual exploitation, mental disorders and cyberbullying as they spend more time at virtual platforms due to closing of schools amid COVID-19 lockdown.
                        Increased, unstructured and unmonitored use of digital platforms may expose children to potentially harmful and violent content as well as cyberbullying.




<br>
                    <h3>Doodle Againsy Cyberbulling</h3>

                        Cyberbullying is a bane of society most of us have experienced or at least witnessed in life.
                        So, rather than normalising it or accepting it as "the way of life" we all should contribute to eliminate it from society.

                        The online world can be difficult, but if you ever find yourself being threatened or troubled by somebody, tell about it to your parents and don't hesitate to report it to any cyber crime cell.

                        It is absolutely important and advisable to report every incident of bullying irrespective of whether we want to pursue a legal case or not.

                        The best thing to do is to try & stop the bullying by taking a stand against it. If you can’t stop it, support the person being bullied. If you’re not already friends, even a kind word can help reduce the pain.

                        Nawazish Crew organised a doodle competition - DOODLE UP! at the enlightening occasion of Pink T-shirt day to create awareness and educate people about cyberbullying.

                        More than 50 students participated in this competition, each describing cyberbullying in their own unique way through the art of doodling and creating a new perspective around it
